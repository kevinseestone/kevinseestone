- 👋 Hi, I’m @kevinseestone
- 👀 I’m interested in getting involved in an open source community or communities, Arsenal FC, the outdoors, building full-stack web apps, DevOps, and automating mundane tasks.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full stack software development along with DevOps tools such as Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes, Rancher, etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will challenge me to grow and learn as a software developer.
